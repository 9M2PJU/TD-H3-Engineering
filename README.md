# TID Station
An application designed to replace the three apps supplied by TIDRADIO into a single app.  
It also allows configuration changes to be made in real time (Live Mode) which gives some remote functionality.
TID Station is currently in Beta, it may be updated frequently and will have bugs and glitches.

The latest version 0.30b has the ability to unlock TX all the way down to 18 MHz. Before some other Edgar with a "lifetime of RF engineering" chimes in virtue signalling, let's just clear something up. It is almost guaranteed the radio will not operate correctly outside of the capabilities of the filters and PA, and I DO NOT condone anyone transmitting where they shouldn't be doing so. I CERTAINLY AM NOT! 

The TD-H3 will not transmit on the Air Band frequencies anyway regardless of the limits.

I am interested in seeing a frequency analysis into a dummy load of the radio on the HF bands though. I suspect it would be the same deal as the Quansheng.


# TA3782F
Most of the components in this radio are well known off the shelf stuff. However this TA3782F MCU is not and there is practically no documentation for it. I initially believed this to be some MCU utilizing an Arm Cortex-M4 core, but now I'm almost convinced this is not the case. I'm leaning toward some kind of Intel 8051 MCU architecture as this is providing some meaningful disassembly in IDA Pro.  

Here's a typical snippet of disassembly of the firmware image assuming Intel 8051 code architecture

```
code:0000B98D code_B98D:                              ; CODE XREF: code_B949+5Bâ†“j
code:0000B98D                 mov     A, #0x52 ; 'R'
code:0000B98F                 add     A, RAM_30
code:0000B991                 mov     DPL, A          ; Data Pointer, Low Byte
code:0000B993                 clr     A
code:0000B994                 addc    A, #4
code:0000B996                 mov     DPH, A          ; Data Pointer, High Byte
code:0000B998                 movx    A, @DPTR
code:0000B999                 mov     R7, A
code:0000B99A                 lcall   code_F101
code:0000B99D                 inc     RAM_30
code:0000B99F                 mov     A, RAM_30
code:0000B9A1                 clr     C
code:0000B9A2                 subb    A, #0x25 ; '%'
code:0000B9A4                 jc      code_B98D
code:0000B9A6                 ret
```

The structure and logic of this section does seem to make sense, it's performing some kind of loop, incrementing a ram pointer, until some condition is met then returning.
